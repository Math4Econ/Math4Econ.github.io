# Preface {-}

`r text_top_count`

This is a work-in-progress [course website](https://Math4Econ.github.io/) for Mathematics for Economists. Course covers a limited subset of topics from [Mathematics for Economists](Mathematics for Economists) [@simonblume1994], and uses various definitions from the book. Applications focus on households' optimal borrowing and savings problems and firms' optimal inputs problems. Matlab is used throughout.

Materials are written in [matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) [@matlab] livescript files and shown as HTML files.

From other repositories: For dynamic borrowing and savings problems, see [MEconTools](https://fanwangecon.github.io/MEconTools/) and [Dynamic Asset Repository](https://fanwangecon.github.io/CodeDynaAsset/); For code examples, see also [Matlab Example Code](https://fanwangecon.github.io/M4Econ/), [Stata Example Code](https://fanwangecon.github.io/Stata4Econ/), [Python Example Code](https://fanwangecon.github.io/pyfan/), [R Example Code](https://fanwangecon.github.io/R4Econ/); For intro econ with Matlab, see [Intro Mathematics for Economists](https://fanwangecon.github.io/Math4Econ/), and for intro stat with R, see [Intro Statistics for Undergraduates](https://fanwangecon.github.io/Stat4Econ/).

The site is built using [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) [@R-bookdown].
